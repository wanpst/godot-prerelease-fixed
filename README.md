# godot-initial-fixed
The first public working version of the Godot Engine, fixed for modern compilers.

The Scons files were Python 2 and there was some broken C++ that prevented compilation, so I fixed both.  
Really, that's it.

I've only tested this on Linux with GCC. [Some old documentation related to compilation](https://web.archive.org/web/20140306184945/http://www.godotengine.org/wiki/doku.php?id=compiling_linux) has been archived.
